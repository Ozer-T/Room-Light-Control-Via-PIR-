//This project made by ZEROCYCLE at April 2017
//Be careful at dealing with HIGH CURRENT 
//If you are not adult, do not attempt to do it!
//Make sure that you have all safety equipments in the place and use them! 
//Cut the lights which you want to connect the room's wall before the process
//No responsibility is taken from me. This is your risk and your choice. Be careful!! :)
